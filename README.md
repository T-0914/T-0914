# Hi there :v:!
Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer. I love learning new technologies, coding and problem solving.

I'm focusing on Web Development and my vision is to learn things in best way and try to create best quality software.

Besides, I'm learning about Rust and Substrate framework to create a blockchain.
